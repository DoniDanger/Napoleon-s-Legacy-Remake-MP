santo_domingo_is_back_desc;During the Napoleonic Wars and the occupation of our homeland, Haiti took the advantage of our weakness to steal Santo Domingo from us before we could crush the Independence Rebels.

form_federation_desc;After the momentous reunifcation or our divided people, many in our nation are calling upon us to recognize this event by establishing a new order that will bring together the partisans of the Union and the Empire and will ensure stability and properity for all places where our nation touches. Many believe that the perfect symbol of a peaceful Britain would be the extension of rights to many of the races that live under our rule, as new ideologies about Britain's mission to civlize the world, combined with the technological wonders shrinking the size of the earth every day, have led many to believe that an Imperial Federation where all people are treated equally and share a common goal must be our nation's future.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;
mechanize_YFE_title;Mechanize the York Factory Express;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;

quell_tensions_saf_title;Quell Tensions in South Africa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
quell_tensions_saf_desc;Although South Africa was returned to the Dutch Republic from Britain with a mix of force and diplomacy, the local populace has not been eager to see our return. Despite the influx of nationalist refugee, our effective influence is limited to Cape Town, and the countryside filled with wary tribes ready to rebel. In order to quell any African rebellion, we must shave our pride and make treaties with these tribes protecting their land from settlement and granting them more rights. This will naturally upset the Boers, but we are here to restore our homeland, not confine ourselves to Africa.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
invite_natives_title;A Common Home;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;
invite_natives_desc;The Native Confederation was founded at the end of the War of 1812 as a buffer state to protect the British Empire's Canadian Dominion from the ambitious Confederate States of America. While the nation was established with the nominal purpose of providing natives with a place to live in peace, few took this seriously, and only the natives who lived in the area became common citizens. However, now that the Confederate States has begun agressively persecuting our bretheren, we might be able to convince many of them to settle here if we have the bureaucracy and capital to handle a mass immigration.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;

spanish_resto_title;The Claim to Spain;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;
spanish_resto_desc;When Napoleon invaded Spain and put his brother on the throne, few accepted him as the legitimate king. However, the true heir and his family were kept imprisoned by Napoleon until they died childless. As a result, the closest living relative happens to be the King of Sicily, due to a claim from Charles III of Spain. As our king is now the heir to the Spanish throne, we can send a delegation to the Cubano Cortes to make our claim.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;

accept_java_desc;Since our government has been sent into exile, our reserves of Dutch citizens have been too few to effectively run our nation. As such, we have been forced to use our colonial population to run the government, educate the populace, and fight our wars. Among them, the Javan people are the most numerous and the most loyal. Let us recognize their contributions by making all Javans honorary Dutch citizens.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;

institute_monarchy_desc;The Princes of the House of Orange have been the hereditary Stadtholders of the Dutch Republic for centuries, occupying a curiously monarchical position in the republican government. They have kept our nation strong and united since we chose to give them command of the Dutch armies, and William of Orange, the current Stadtholder, has perhaps done the most. Through his efforts, we have held our nation together in exile and held on to the hope of reclaiming our homeland. To strengthen the executive branch, let us officially make the House of Orange hereditary monarchs of our nation.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;
move_capital_title;The Return to London;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;
